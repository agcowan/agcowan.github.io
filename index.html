  <p>My name is Andrew Cowan, I live in Atlanta, GA and I currently work as a Claims Data and Systems Analyst at a large multinational reinsurer.
    In my spare time, I work at high schools around Atlanta officiating football games during the fall.</p>
  <p>My hobbies include playing ultimate frisbee and ballroom dancing for both the enjoyment and the socializing aspects as I am an extrovert and love being with people</p>
